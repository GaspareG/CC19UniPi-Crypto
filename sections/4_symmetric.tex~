% \centering

How to handle messages of length not multiple of the block size?

\smallskip

Idea: append "some chars" to the message

\bigskip

\textbf{PKCS\#5}:

\textit{The padding string PS shall consist of $8 - (||M|| \mod 8)$ octets all having value $8 - (||M|| \mod 8).$}

\bigskip

\textbf{PKCS\#7}:

\textit{For such algorithms, the method shall be to pad the input at the trailing end with $k - (l \mod k)$ octets all having value $k - (l \mod k)$, where $l$ is the length of the input.}

\bigskip

Why $8 - (||M|| \mod 8)$ and not $(||M|| \mod 8)$?
