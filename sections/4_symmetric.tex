\begin{frame}{Symmetric-key cryptography}

  Symmetric ciphers are those where messages are encrypted and decrypted using the \textcolor{red}{same key}, which must be known only and exclusively to the two parts
  
  \medskip

  \phantom{padding}$\mathcal{C}(m, k) = c$ (encrypt function)
    
  \phantom{padding}$\mathcal{D}(c, k) = m$ (decrypt function)
  
  \medskip

  Obviously:
  
  \phantom{padding}$\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{C}(m, k), k) = m$ 
  
  \phantom{padding}The original message is \textcolor{red}{not altered} during the communication
  
  \medskip
  
  E.g. In the caesar cipher:
  
  \phantom{padding}$\mathcal{C}(m, k) = $ right shift of $k$ positions each character
  
  \phantom{padding}$\mathcal{D}(c, k) = $ left shift of $k$ positions each character

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Shannon principle}

  How to assess whether a cipher is robust enough? 
  
  (Where robustness means its probability of being successfully attacked)
  
  \medskip

  Shannon defines two key concepts:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textcolor{red}{Confusion}: the key must be well distributed in the encrypted message (each bit of the cipher should depend on each bit of the key with probability 50\%)
    \item \textcolor{red}{Diffusion}: the message must be well distributed in the encrypted message (each bit of the cipher should depend on each bit of the message with probability 50\%)
  \end{itemize}
  
  \medskip
  
  In the Caesar cipher we have no kind of diffusion and low confusion (why?)

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{XOR cipher}

  Consider the \textcolor{red}{XOR} (exclusive or) operation $\oplus$, the following properties are valid:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $0 \oplus 0 = 1 \oplus 1 = 0$ 
    \item $0 \oplus 1 = 1 \oplus 0 = 1$ 
    \item $x \oplus y \oplus y = x$ 
  \end{itemize}
  
  \medskip
  \pause
  
  We define the XOR cipher as:\\
    
  \phantom{pad}$\mathcal{C}(m, k) = m \oplus k$ \phantom{padding} ($m[i] \oplus k[i]$, $0 \leq i < ||m||$)\\
  
  \phantom{pad}$\mathcal{D}(c, k) = c \oplus k$ \phantom{paddingg} ($c[i] \oplus k[i]$, $0 \leq i < ||c||$)

  \medskip
  
  \pause

  Problem: the key $k$ could be \textcolor{red}{shorter} than the message $m$
  
  Solution: reuse the key as $k^{'} = k \cdot k \cdot \ldots \cdot k$ until $||k^{'}|| \geq m$

  \medskip
  \pause
  
  Example:
  
  \phantom{pad}\texttt{m = 01100011 01101001 01100001 01101111} (ciao in ASCII).\\
  \phantom{pad}\texttt{k = 01111000 01111000 01111000 01111000} (x in ascii 4 times)\\
  \phantom{pad}\texttt{c = 00011011 00010001 00011001 00010111} (non printable, \texttt{GxEZFw==} in b64)
  
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{One-time pad}

  \pause

  The problem with the XOR cipher is that encrypting repeatedly reusing the same key can leak \textcolor{red}{statistical informations} of the original message  
  
  \medskip
  
  We call Vernam cipher (or one-time pad) a XOR cipher where the key has the same length of the message. 
  
  \smallskip
  
  This cipher is called \textcolor{red}{perfect} because we have that:
  
  \medskip
  
  \phantom{pad}$P(M = m | C = c) = P(M = m)$
  
  \medskip
  
  The probability that $M$ is a certain message $m$ knowing that the cipher $C$ is $c$ is equal to the probability that $M$ is a certain message not knowing the cipher (all messages are equiprobable, the encrypted message does not give us any information about the real message)
  
  \medskip
  
  \pause

  Nice in theory, but:
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The key must be exchanged using a secure method (exchange them by \textit{hand})
    \item The key must be generated randomly and not reused (otherwise a many-time pad attack is possible)
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Padding a message (PKCS\#5 \& PKCS\#7)}

How to handle messages of length not multiple of the block size?

\smallskip

Idea: append "some chars" to the message (\textcolor{red}{padding string})

\bigskip

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{PKCS\#5}}:

\textit{The padding string PS shall consist of $8 - (||M|| \mod 8)$ octets all having value $8 - (||M|| \mod 8)$}

\bigskip

\textcolor{red}{\textbf{PKCS\#7}}:

\textit{For such algorithms, the method shall be to pad the input at the trailing end with $k - (l \mod k)$ octets all having value $k - (l \mod k)$, where $l$ is the length of the input}

\bigskip

Why $8 - (||M|| \mod 8)$ and not $(||M|| \mod 8)$?
