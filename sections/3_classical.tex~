\begin{frame}{Caesar cipher}

\smallskip

Encrypt: left shift each letter of 3 positions

\smallskip

Decrypt: right shift each letter of 3 positions

\medskip

\medskip

General cipher: shift letter of $K$ positions

\smallskip

Attack: bruteforce all the possible $K$ (only $26$...)

\begin{frame}{ROT\{13, 47\}}

\centering

\medskip

ROT13: Caesar cipher with $K = 13$ on alphabetic dictionary

ROT47: Caesar cipher with $K = 47$ on printable ASCII chars (33 - 126).

\medskip

\medskip

Why $K = 13$ (or $K = 47$)? Because Encrypt = Decrypt

\begin{frame}{Substitution cipher}


\medskip

Monoalphabetic cipher: $C_{new} = P[C_{old}]$ (Where $P$ is a dictionary permutation)

\medskip

Polialphabetic cipher: multiple substitution alphabets (more than one dictionary permutation)
